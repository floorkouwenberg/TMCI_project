# Final Project: Text Mining and Collective Intelligence
## Floor Kouwenberg, Lanie Preston, and Jasmijn Bleijlevens 

## Title

## Abstract
We would like to create a classifier that can predict the number of stars a food item will recieve in an Amazon review based on sentiment analysis of the language in the review. We would also like to examine the co-occurences of positive or negative words with specific nouns in the review so we have an understanding of which specific aspects of the product are good and which aspects of the product are bad. We will achieve this by   

A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?
